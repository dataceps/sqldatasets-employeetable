Hey!
I am glad you have reached to chapter 7. Now it's time for you to **play with the data**.

Click on the link below to download the SQL script file for the Employee table you created in your MyEcommerceDB database.

Just download this "**DataEmployeeTable.sql**" file and follow the following steps:
1) Open the "**DataEmployeeTable.sql**" downloaded file
2) Click on the **Execute** button or press F5.
3) Let it insert data in **[dbo].[Employee]**  table
4) Check if the data is populated by execting the below command:
                         **SELECT * FROM  [dbo].[Employee]**
